    <h1>Surface Area Visualization</h1>
    <p>Last night I watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/112319901">Michael Bostock's 2014 Eyeo talk on Algorithm Visualization</a> and was blown away at how effectively he leveraged visualizations as part of his explanations of various algorithms. While he visualized concepts like the distribution of photoreceptors, sorting, and maze generation, I would like to take a look at an even more important issue: cooking eggs. I bought a new pan after my medium sized pan's (figure 1) non-stick surface had been scrubbed out of existence. When I used it to prepare breakfast the next day, I looked at the eggs I cooked and thought, "damn, I'm good at this". When I achieved similar culinary success the next day, I grew suspicious. Instead of claiming the credit for myself, I began to suspect that the pan had something to do with it.</p>
